# WordPress Numeronyms

> It's a number! It's a word! It's both!

A numeronym is a number-based word to shorten a long word into a word that can be partially represented by numbers. It is created by the first letter of a word, followed by the number of characters between the first and last letter ending with the last letter of a word. In this way you can type the same with less characters. This is an advantage for someone who is disabled to type on a keyboard and it saves times writing.

This WordPress plugin creates a numeronym redirect for every post and page in WordPress. When the numeronym link is visited it automaticly redirects to de original post or page url.
